Step 1 - Interface TMS570LC43 TI board with Victron venus gx for getting the Solar power ,Inverter and battery charger data - MODBUS TCP communication protocol.Hardware is ready for this task
Data required from MPPT - Solar voltage,Solar power,



Step 2 - Interface TMS570LC43 TI board with Lithium Balance C- BMS for getting battery data  -  CANbus Communication protocol . Hardware is ready.
Step 3 - Interface TMS570LC43 TI board with RTU unit which we already developed with InQube - Hardware raedy
Step 4 - Interface TMS570LC43 with Wecon make LCD display unit PI8070 model - Hardware ready
Step 5 - Switching the four contactors with TMS570LC43 for controlling the charger,inverter,MPPT etc. Switching algorithm is designed by us.
